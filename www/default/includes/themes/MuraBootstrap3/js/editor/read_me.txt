All files in the editor directory are intended to override default CK Editor behavior. You can add styles to styles.js, add templates to templates/default.js & dialogs/templates.js, and configure CK Editor itself by renaming config.js.cfm.txt to config.js.cfm (remove.txt) and edit per the CK Editor documentation. Any file ending with .cfm can be used to add dynamic or conditional behavior via CFML.
